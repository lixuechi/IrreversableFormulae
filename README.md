3D alchemy-themed RPG by unity

This is a demo of an alchemy-themed RPG. For it is still a simple and short demo, the player can travel around Rabbit Village for now. As an alchemist himself, the player needs to collect certain types of crystals or solution to make alchemy substances. If you're tired of going around far ways to collect those crystals and solution, you can fight against the trolls to get them.

Why I started this game? Actually "IF"(thisGame.name) came up to me several years ago, when I firstly came up with the idea of developing video games. Some friends gathered together then to discuss ideas and hoped to put our ideas together so that we would develop an awesome game with a broad context. Now I hardly keep in touch with any one of them, and I doubt who are still sticking to the ideas. As a maniac myself, I'd build this semicolon by semicolon to reach IF's ending. Additionally, I'd like to regard the idea of IF as the origin of my video game development career.

Only Chinese version for the first chapter of IF is available currently, I may translate it to English someday, but that depends.
